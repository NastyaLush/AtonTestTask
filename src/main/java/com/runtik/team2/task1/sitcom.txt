RACHEL: Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?
GUY: Huh?
RACHEL: Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before. [picks up the tip he leaves] Only $98.50 to go.
MONICA: Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?
ROSS: No, they're not.
MONICA: Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them.
ROSS: You're wrong.
MONICA: I am not wrong.
ROSS: You're wrong.
MONICA: No, I just talked to them.
ROSS: [getting up, upset] I'm calling Mom.
JOEY: Hey, hey.
CHANDLER: Hey.
PHOEBE: Hey.
CHANDLER: And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?
JOEY: Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.
CHANDLER: That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman.
PHOEBE: What were you modeling for?
JOEY: You know those posters for the city free clinic?
MONICA: Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those "healthy, healthy, healthy guys"?
PHOEBE: You know, the asthma guy was really cute.
CHANDLER: Do you know which one you're gonna be?
JOEY: No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so... [crosses fingers]
CHANDLER: Good luck, man. I hope you get it.
JOEY: Thanks.
